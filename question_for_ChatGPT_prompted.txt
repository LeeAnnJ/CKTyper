**recommand top-k answers:
Please infer the fully qualified names (FQNs) of the given API elements. Given a code snippet, you should recommand 5 most possible FQNs for each API in Json format, and the most possible ones rank first, such as  {'API element': ['<FQN1>','<FQN2>',...], 'API element': ['<FQN1>','<FQN2>', ... ], ...}.
